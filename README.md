<p>This website demonstrates my use of JavaScript in form validation and DOM manipulation. The form allows the input of numbers, radio buttons, checkboxes, and text fields. Addition and multiplication is used to calculate the total cost of products. The form displays an alert if the required information is not filled out, and will display as red in the incorrect field until it is filled correctly. Once the form is successfully validated, it will display all of the information from the form in a text area.</p>
